# Release v1.0.0:
- [x] Detect platform automatically
    - We should avoid making the user manually select, only in edge cases.
- [x] Default installation location
    - Let user choose default installation location, and ask if they want to be asked per installation.
- [x] Download NZ:P for platform
    -  Once we know the users platform, we can download the latest release.
- [x] Allow playing NZ:P from launcher
    - The user wants to, of course, play the game. We should allow this without making them search for the executable.
    - We should also check if the executable is *there*.
- [ ] Auto-updating
    - We can look at the latest NZ:P release and see what's changed (where it says, "Changes in the following areas have been made since the last nightly:"), so we're not re-downloading the entire game so we can preserve mods (unless overwritten by changes), user maps, settings, etc.
- [x] Make her purr-ty
    - Make the NZ:P Launcher pretty!
- [ ] Auto-update the launcher
    - To provide security and the latest features to users, we should auto-update the launcher as well.
- [ ] Save window preferences
    - If they want it maximized, launch maximized. If they want it 495x434, save that preference. So on, so forth.
- [ ] Add GitHub Workflows for PRs & main branch pushes
    - Add workflows that'll build (but not publish) the NZ:P Launcher on Windows & Linux to ensure builds work.
- [ ] Add PR and issue templates
- [ ] Release v1.0.0!
    - Yippee!
